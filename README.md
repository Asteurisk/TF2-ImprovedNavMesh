# TF2-ImprovedNavMesh
This is the Team Fortress 2 - Improved Navigation Mesh project.  The purpose of this project is to develop and supply improved and/or brand new navigation mesh files for official and community maps.


# THIS PROJECT HAS ENDED- THANKS, EVERYONE!

Hi all,

This project was something I passionately worked on in an effort to improve a game I love so much. As time has passed, I no longer have as much time to give to this project, and my time spent playing Team Fortress has slowly gone down.

Unfortunately, I can no longer support this project as I once did, so this is my notice that I will no longer be supporting or updating this mod. You can still download the navmesh, but understand that updates are unlikely, or may never come.

As a final note, please continue to love and support this game and its community. There are many people who have poured hours and hours of their personal time to help make Team Fortress 2 more fun for everyone. Or even better- make something yourself! It can be a map, a hat, a particle effect, a simple mod- just make something you enjoy. There's lots you can learn just by creating.
